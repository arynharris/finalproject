			<p>We first researched common voting statistics and decided that our target users would be people that are not registered to vote.</p>

			<img src="images/vote-four.PNG" alt="vote-four">
			<p>We then created our user personas.</p>

	    <div>
			<img src="images/vote-three.PNG" alt="vote-three">
			<p>We decided what our voice and tone guidelines would be, meaning how we want our app voice to sound and the tone it should use.</p>

			<img src="images/vote-two.PNG" alt="vote-two">
			<p>Lastly, we created our CUI by deciding its' entities(words uttered together that trigger the CUI answers) and we made a prototype in Adobe XD</p>
